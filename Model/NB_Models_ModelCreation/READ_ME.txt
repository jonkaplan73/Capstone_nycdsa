README:
In this directory we have the following files.

'final_multiNB_model.sav' - a pickled object file that contains a fitted Naive Bayes Model
'final_NB_countvec.sav' - a pickled object that contains a count vectorizer to insure our input data is prepared the same way as our train set was when fitting the Naive Bayes Model.
'NaiveBayes.ipynb'- Jupiter notebook used to build the models. The script will...

1. Import the data we were given
2. Use the mapped_brands provided and predicted mapped brands from a dictionary look-up to train a model - see the dictionary directory for more details.
3. Save the models as pickled objects (three .sav files) that we will upload in the run.py file.
